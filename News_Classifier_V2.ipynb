    "\n",
    "Over the past few decades, news sources have drastically shifted from print media to\n",
    "online sites due to the widespread adoption of the internet by the general public. As a\n",
    "consequence of this shift, it has become easier for news articles from untrustworthy\n",
    "sources to pass themselves as real, and cause disinformation to spread rapidly. This\n",
    "disinformation can cause widespread damage and is often used to push false narratives to\n",
    "benefit a political party or a government. It has already caused harm to democratic\n",
    "institutions by eroding trust in media sources, as well as motivating extreme actions based\n",
    "on incorrect information, such as the Capitol Riots on January 6, 2021 . Therefore, it is now\n",
    "more important than ever to develop sound methods for determining whether a news\n",
    "story is real, or not. The intent of this project will be to use deep learning in order to train a\n",
    "model that can correctly classify a list of news stories as real or not real.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "1. Train a deep learning model for binary classification to correctly classify whether a\n",
    "news story is real\n",
    "2. Test Trained Model on a dataset to determine how well it differentiates between the\n",
    "two classes, and report findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "The dataset, as well as the direct inspiration for this project, comes from the following kaggle\n",
    "website, and the author of the code has some good insights that will be reused here as well.\n",

      "Most frequent string value: '(Reuters) - Highlights for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday: The United States drops a massive GBU-43 bomb, the largest non-nuclear bomb it has ever used in combat, in Afghanistan against a series of caves used by Islamic State militants, the Pentagon says. Trump says Pyongyang is a problem that “will be taken care of” amid speculation that North Korea is on the verge of a sixth nuclear test. Military force cannot resolve tension over North Korea, China warns, while an influential Chinese newspaper urges Pyongyang to halt its nuclear program in exchange for Beijing’s protection. The Trump administration is focusing its North Korea strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang, U.S. officials say. Trump says “things will work out fine” between the United States and Russia, a day after declaring U.S.-Russian relations may be at an all-time low. Trump signals he could be moving closer to the mainstream on monetary policy, saying he has not ruled out reappointment of Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair as he considers his choices for the U.S. central bank. [nL1N1HL14B] Trump signs a resolution that will allow U.S. states to restrict how federal funds for contraception and reproductive health are spent, a move cheered by anti-abortion campaigners. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen presses Deutsche Bank to release information about issues including Trump’s debt and any bank meetings with Trump administration officials, saying he has “great concern” about possible conflicts of interest. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK Trump’s office says he plans to revive the hobbled Export-Import Bank of the United States, a victory for American manufacturers such as Boeing Co and General Electric Co that have overseas customers that use the agency’s government-backed loans to purchase their products. Top Wall Street bankers say they are having positive discussions about financial regulation in Washington, and downplay the idea U.S. policymakers may force their institutions to split up. The United States is pushing for trade to be a key issue in top-level economic talks with Japan, a source says, an unwelcome development for Tokyo, which is seeking to fend off U.S. pressure to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance. Trump’s administration has focused on one group of illegal immigrants more than others: women with children, according to eight Department of Homeland Security officials interviewed by Reuters about agency planning.

    "A cursory glance at the data shows that there are no missing values in either data set and that both column types\n",
    "are the same along with matching data types. There are no numerical columns her, only text and dates. However, the author of the original project points out that the **True.csv** file  shows **WASHINGTON (Reuters) - ** or **SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters)** before the news articles. Also, there are **6** unique values for **'subject'** in the **Fake.csv** file and only **2** unique values for **'subject'** in the **True.csv**, which might cause the model while training the dataset to mainly look for these two things to determine whether the news article is fake. We will want to remove these things in order to ensure that it's not so obvious which one is which, and also ensure that the model will be able to work when classifying news stories that do not have this format, as one could then easily add the <Reuters> term to a fake news story, in order to trick the model into classifying it is as true.\n",
