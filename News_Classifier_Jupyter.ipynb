    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few decades, news sources have drastically shifted from print media to\n",
    "online sites due to the widespread adoption of the internet by the general public. As a\n",
    "consequence of this shift, it has become easier for news articles from untrustworthy\n",
    "sources to pass themselves as real, and cause disinformation to spread rapidly. This\n",
    "disinformation can cause widespread damage and is often used to push false narratives to\n",
    "benefit a political party or a government. It has already caused harm to democratic\n",
    "institutions by eroding trust in media sources, as well as motivating extreme actions based\n",
    "on incorrect information, such as the Capitol Riots on January 6, 2021 . Therefore, it is now\n",
    "more important than ever to develop sound methods for determining whether a news\n",
    "story is real, or not. The intent of this project will be to use deep learning in order to train a\n",
    "model that can correctly classify a list of news stories as real or not real.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "1. Train a deep learning model for binary classification to correctly classify whether a\n",
    "news story is real\n",
    "2. Test Trained Model on a dataset to determine how well it differentiates between the\n",
    "two classes, and report findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "The dataset, as well as the inspiration for this project, comes from the following kaggle\n",
